# Regional-Temperature-Effects-on-Child-Nutrition

The study in [Regional-Temperature-Effects-on-Child-Nutrition](https://github.com/nataliacancinogarcia/Regional-Temperature-Effects-on-Child-Nutrition/blob/main/regional-temperature-effects-on-child-nutrition.ipynb)  investigates the impact of rising temperatures  on child nutrition , focusing on children aged 1-5  across regions defined by the World Bank. The key goal 🎯 is to understand how temperature variations influence child health indicators  such as weight-for-age (WAZ) ⚖️, height-for-age (HAZ) , and weight-for-height (WHZ)  while considering socio-economic factors .

The analysis was conducted using R programming language , and a Tableau dashboard has been created for an interactive exploration of the data.
