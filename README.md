# Regional-Temperature-Effects-on-Child-Nutrition

The study 🌍 investigates the impact of rising temperatures 🌡️ on child nutrition 🍽️, focusing on children aged 1-5 👶 across regions defined by the World Bank. The key goal 🎯 is to understand how temperature variations influence child health indicators 🧒 such as weight-for-age (WAZ) ⚖️, height-for-age (HAZ) 📏, and weight-for-height (WHZ) 📊 while considering socio-economic factors 💼.

The analysis was conducted using R programming language 💻, and a Tableau dashboard 📊 has been created for an interactive exploration of the data.
